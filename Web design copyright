    <h1> Understanding Copyright in Web Design</h1>
	
	<!--A paragraph explainging what is copyright-->
	<p> There are so many things to think about when Copyright is a form of intellectual property law, that protects original works of authorship
	including literary, drama, musical, and artistic works (including web design), poetry, novels,
	 movies, songs, computer software, and architecture.<br>
	 A website may contain text, artwork, photographs, music, videos, or other copyrightable content,
    the website itself is not typically considered a copyrightable work.  You might be able to register
	a website or a specific web page if it satisfies the statutory requirements for a compilation or collective work.

    <!--A list of Copyrightable Content on a Website-->
	<h2> <strong>A List of Copyrightable Content on a Website .</strong></h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong> Website Content:</strong> hen trying to copyright website content the individual wouldn't request the whole website, but
		     they would choose the components in the website that meets satisfactory to the requirements of copyright.
			 For example: If you had a blog and you wanted to protect the text that is original you would request 
			 copyrights for literature.
			 Another example if a photographer posted pictures on the website they would request copyrights for images
			 as visual art.<br></li>
			 
			 <li><strong>Website as a whole</strong><br>
			 A website may qualify as a compilation or a collective work if there is sufficient creativity in the overall hierarchy 
			of the website, such as the ways in which the pages are connected or linked with one another.
			When you register a website as a compilation or a collective work, the registration may cover
            both the website as a whole and the individual works that appear on the site—but only if the
            claimant fully owns the copyrights in both the compilation and the underlying works at the time of registration.</li>
			
			<li><strong>HTML</strong><br>
			HTML may be registered as a literary work only if it was created by a human being and it
            contains a sufficient amount of creative expression.
			</li>
			
			<li><strong> Author of a Website and Its Content</strong>
			  When an individual creates a work he or she is considered the author of that work for
             copyright purposes. If two or more authors create a work, they may be considered joint authors, and
             their work may be considered a joint work.</li>
